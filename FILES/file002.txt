and iron heels under the guidance of that renegade anglo egyptian  george fahdi     the crazy years since the war had passed  and now all the strong new lines were drawn  don   t step over my line  look at my armies  my bomber fleets  my missile stations  don   t step over my line     malthus would have called the war a failure  it killed only seven millions  and each day  branson knew  eighty thousand new souls and mouths were added to the world 
 eighty thousand net  nearly thirty millions a year  the old ant heap pressure  leaning on us again  the eighty thousand increment each day was a jackstraw to be placed carefully on a precarious structure  use steady hands  there  you aren   t building it right  build it my way  build it my way  or else       the fourth world war coming in from the deeps  rolling up in an oily way  ready to crest and smash on what was left of the world 
 and now  each time  it had to be the last one  yet  somehow  it never was     the clown world fought for balance  the comedian stepped off into space      branson left his desk and walked over to the window  rent cheaply and in fear  and you get a window to look out of  an expensive office would have a clever diorama where the window would be  the psychologists had become important to underground architecture  if a man must live and work underground 
 it must be made to look like above ground  because man is not a mole     in the bright noisy dusk of new times square  ten stories below  the crowds moved slowly  american cars wheezed and clattered through the streets  their turbines laboring under the low grade fuels  here and there he could see a long glittering taj or a brahma  cars whose cost and upkeep were far beyond the purse of anyone who worked for wages  the indians made the best 
automobiles in the world  tata automotive designed cars for looks and power  while what was left of detroit had to concentrate on substitute materials  on fuel economy  on standardization of design from year to year  some of the foreign cars  he knew  would be driven by tourists from pak india  it was sometimes difficult to stomach their arrogance  their conscious certainty that everything in india was better than here in the states  far better  they had  somehow  become the brash new 
nation  the young giant born in ashes  rising to strength     but  branson knew  they had to be dealt with delicately  their tourist rupees were sadly needed  and their embassies were powerful  odd how  if you didn   t speak either hindi or tamil  they thought they could make you understand by yelling at you  their president  gondohl lahl  had that same arrogance  the only product of america which india seemed to approve of wholeheartedly was the beauty of its long legged girls 
    some of the weariness of the past year left darwin branson as he thought that it was barely conceivable that now  through his own efforts  the war tide might be halted  the drums and bugles stilled  his mission had been a secret one  entrusted to him by that wise  farsighted president of the united states  robert enfield  from the practical point of view  it had merely been a piece of horsetrading  enfield  and the other leaders  had known that the economy 
could not stand another war  india could get nowhere by demanding  and she refused to plead  the triple coalition would not deal with india directly on these matters  the united states became thesub rosa contact between them     what darwin branson had seen in buenos aires  in alexandria  in shanghai  in bombay  had convinced him  all over again  that the nature of man is good  rather than evil  there was fear all over the world  now  at last  the era of the 
man of good will could be initiated     it had been a hole and corner affair  meetings in furtive places  in cheap offices such as this one  two more meetings and the deal could be made  a new mutual assistance pact for the world at large  something  at last  with meaning  something that would unwind the hard strands of fear and give mankind breathing space again  give him time to look around     he looked at his watch  another twenty minutes of thought 
 of solitude  and they would join him  young dake lorin who had been his assistant  his husky right arm during the long year of cautious dickering  and that strange englishman  smith  who was empowered by his leader  george fahdi  to make a deal  once all the offers were in  president gondohl lahl could be contacted  see the concessions the others will make  and this is all they want from you  the net result will be a bettering of the standard of 
living in every nation involved  and that will mean an easing of the tension  he had it on good authority that gondohl lahl would go along with it  and he knew that smith would be cooperative     he stood at the window  a small tired man with white hair and a furrowed face  eyes with a look of kindness  midwife to peace  that was what robert had called him     fifteen more minutes  he heard footsteps in the empty corridor  thinking they had 
arrived earlier than planned  he went to the door and opened it  the young couple seemed unremarkable  they had better than average looks  and a disconcertingly assured way        i   m afraid you have the wrong office     darwin branson said politely        i   m afraid we have the right one  sir     the young man said  almost regretfully  there was always the danger of assassination by fanatics  yet this couple did not have that special look  unmistakable once seen     darwin branson was still pondering 
that point when the young man killed him  so quickly  with such an astounding speed that there was no interval between life and death  no period wherein darwin branson was permitted to be aware that life had gone and the great darkness had begun     the girl caught the body  carried it lightly and easily into the alcove  she stood  holding the body  her face expressionless  while her companion made quick preparations  the hand tool made a faint electronic whirr  she placed
