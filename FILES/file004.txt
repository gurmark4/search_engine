on my shoulder  and a fat urge to change the world so that things like that couldn   t happen           quite a dream to have           i suppose so  anyway  it gave me a drive  i learned the hard way that i couldn   t change the world by punching it in the mouth  so i decided to instruct the world  i became a two bit messiah in the newspaper game  but that   s like knocking down stone walls with your head  what you 
tell them ontuesday they can   t remember on wednesday  then i interviewed darwin branson and later it seemed as if he   d been interviewing me  for the first time i   d found a man i could talk to  a man who believed     just as i believe     in the innate decency of mankind  i talked my fool head off  and went back  unofficially  to talk some more  then  when i heard he was going to retire  i felt lost  as though the 
one sane man left in the world had given up  he got in touch with me and put his new assignment on the line  i got out of newspaper work right then  and we   ve been working on it for a year           and it   s still a dream  mr  lorin           i   ll have to let mr  branson tell you about that           it has been my experience  mr  lorin  that visionary tactics do not fit the world of practical international politics           look 
at it this way  mr  smith  we   ve been carrying a double load of fear ever since hiroshima  every one of us  it has an effect on every joint human action  from marriage to treaties  fear makes each nation  each combination of nations  aggressive  and that aggressive outlook adds to the increment of fear  each power group has established    talking points     thus  everyone has demands to make  demands that will apparently not be met           we demand that pak india cease acts 
of aggression on their northwest frontier           precisely  and it seems that all the demands balance out  in other words  if  through one vast treaty agreement  all the    talking points    could be eliminated  it would give us the breathing space we need and     it might lead to the habit of similar world treaties in the future  once a new set of demands and    talking points    have been set up  the result may be visionary  the method is practical  mr  smith           we will 
not make concessions     smith said firmly        stop talking like your leader  mr  smith  forgive my bluntness  talk as a man  a living  thinking organism  you have ambition  otherwise you would not have reached such a high place under george fahdi  being in a high place  you sense the precariousness of your position  what would you give to be able to look ten years into the future and see yourself still important  still trusted  still     safe           life is not that certain           yet 
we all want it to be that certain  we want to know that we will be free to live  and love  and be happy  yet  as nations  we act in such a way that it increases rather than reduces our uncertainty  as though we were under some compulsion  like lemmings  racing to the sea to drown themselves mr  branson does not believe that it is necessary that  through our acts as nations  we must live in fear  he believes that  acting 
as nations  acting in good will  we can make this world as good a place to live as it was during the first fourteen years of this century  your leader is a man  just as you are  as i am  he does not need aggression to consolidate his position  he needs a constantly increasing standard of living to make his place secure  proper treaties  proper utilization of world resources  can make that possible           you sound like a free trader from the 
history books           perhaps  i am not as convincing as mr  branson           war  mr  lorin  is a cyclical phenomenon           that   s been our traditional excuse  it   s a cycle  who can stop cycles  it   s sunspots  who can change the sun  mr  branson calls that statistical rationalization           your mr  branson sounds like an impressive man           he is  believe me  he is         dake parked the car in a garage near new times square and they walked through the last faint grayness of dusk 
toward the rented office  dake was dismally aware that if smith wished to apply the trite fascist tag of decadent democracy  new times square gave him overpowering opportunity  there was no use telling a man like smith that what he was seeing was a fringe world  a place of fetid lunacies  not at all typical of the heartland of the country where stubborn  dogged men were working in lab and field and mine to re create  through substitution  the lost wealth 
of a great nation  the problem of the world  as branson had said so many times  was in the field of bionomics  man has made his environment precarious for himself  by denuding it of what he needs  this problem of mankind  the great and pressing problem  is to readjust that environment to make it once more a place where man can exist  human nature  branson maintained stoutly  does not have to be changed  it is basically good  evil acts are the 
products of fear  uncertainty  insecurity     the war of the seventies had caused a further moral deterioration  man sought escape in orgy  in soul deadening drugs  in curious sadisms  along    th street the fleng joints were in full cry  in the mouth of an alley three women  loaded to the gills with prono  were mercilessly beating a japanese sailor  giggling couples pushed their way into a dingy triditorium to rent the shoddy private rooms where the three gleaming curved walls were three 
dimensional screens for a life size  third rate showing of one of the obscene feature shows turned out in the listless hollywood mill  censorship restricted such public showings to heterosexual motifs  but further uptown  private triditoriums showed imported specialties that would gag a gnu     the land was full of sects which  in revulsion at the metropolitan moralities  had founded new religions that insisted on complete celibacy among the fanatic congregations  each member pledged never to reproduce his kind  a chanting line
