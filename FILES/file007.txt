influential  i feel that your cooperation is in the public service        haggins looked flustered  he got up and walked to the nearest diorama as though he were staring out a window  he had a curious habit of walking on his toes  he clasped his hands behind him  wriggling his thumbs        you     ah     hand us a very hot potato  mr  lorin           any good story is likely to be  isn   t it           as you know  in exposing corruption  venality  we are absolutely fearless 
          so i   ve heard     dake said dryly        however  there is one consideration here which we must examine     ah     rather closely           and that is           the possibility that our motives might be misinterpreted  mr  lorin  you have stated that this was all     secret negotiation  i refer now  of course  to the public disservice act of        it would not give us recourse to any court of law  or any chance to state our own case  the board might arbitrarily consider our publication of your 
story a disservice to the state  you know the answer to that  confiscatory fines           i feel that it is worth the risk        haggins turned toward him    risk is in direct ratio to what you have to lose  is it not           that act itself is the result of fear  if there were less fear in the world  mr  haggins  that act might be repealed        haggins came back to the desk  dake could see that he had reached a decision  he was more 
at ease  he said    a bit visionary  mr  lorin     he smiled     we do our best  mr  lorin  we feel that we improve the world  improve our environment  in many modest  but effective ways  now you would have us take something that i can only consider as a vast gamble  if we should win  the gain is rather questionable  should we lose  the loss is definite  by losing we would forfeit our chance to continue to do good in our own way 
          in other words  it   s a lack of courage  mr  haggins        haggins flushed  stood up  his hand outstretched    good luck to you  sir  i trust you will find a publisher who will be a bit more     rash  shall we say     he coughed     and naturally  i will not mention this to anyone  i would not care to be accused of a personal disservice  i am a bit too old to work on the oil shale        dake looked at the pink  neatly manicured 
hand  after a few moments haggins withdrew it  rubbed it nervously on the side of his trousers  dake nodded abruptly and left the office  took the elevator up the reinforced concrete shaft to ground level  fear was a tangible thing in the world  fear  on the government level  the business level  the personal level  live out your neat little life and hope for the best  fools took chances  men carried weapons when they walked the night streets  dake did not  his 
very size protected him adequately  his size and his look of dark  compressed fury     he ate soybean steak in a small dismal restaurant and continued his search  atlife look and attime week the brushoff was less delicate  but just as effective     at dusk he managed an interview in a rattle trap building in jersey city  an interview with a vast brick red irishman with a whisky rasp and a smell of barbershop     the irishman interrupted him    fleng the theories  lorin  all 
that prono soup is over my head  you want to reach people  i   ve got a circulation  so let   s get down to it  how about the stash  the dinero  the rupees  the happy old dollars           how do you mean           i   m used to fighting  hell  i   ve got the most pornographic set of comic strips this side of capetown  they   re always trying to shut me down  i got a half million press run  so i do this  i put 
a banner head  paid advertising  it says  not the opinion of the publisher  it says  i give you inside page one  and you write it and sign it  thirty thousand rupees it costs you  sixty thousand bucks  lay it on the line and you can use that page for any damn thing you want  you can use it to challenge gondohl lahl to a personal fistfight if you want to  you   ll do a labor camp stretch if thatenfield crowd doesn 
  t like it  and kelly will still be here  operating at the old stand  that   s the deal  and take it or leave it           how much down           the whole thing down  they   ll confiscate anything you got before they ship you out  i can   t take chances           it   s a lot of money  kelly           you look like a guy with a lot of money           i   ll have to     check with some friends  i   ll make a decision and come in tomorrow 
and tell you           if the answer is no  don   t bother to come in  i won   t dicker  that   s the price  it stands  what are you doing tonight  i got a couple cute little singhalese tourists lined up  and four freebees to a new private tridi way uptown           no thanks  see you tomorrow           not too early  i expect to have a hangover         dake went back to the city and bought passage to philadelphia on one of the feeder lines maintained 
by calcutta international jetways  cij used all indian personnel for their major schedules  but hired u s  personnel for the feeder lines  entrusting to them the creaking  outmoded aircraft  once u s  owned airlines had linked the entire world  but  in the exhaustion following the war  with the regimentation and labor allocations that had cut travel so severely  the airlines  starved for freight and passengers  had slid inevitably toward bankruptcy  in spite of the subsidies of an impoverished federal government  thus 
 when cij had made a reasonable offer for all lines and franchises  the airlines had taken it gladly  the investors receiving cij stock in return for their holdings  cij service was quick  impersonal  efficient  there were only two other passengers on the sixty seat aircraft  dake knew that cij took a continual loss on the new york    philadelphia run  but maintained the frequent schedule for the convenience of the indian nationals who supervised their investments in both cities  he leaned back
