   john d  macdonald    ballroom of the skies       we have given you a world as contradictory    as a female  as cabbalistic as the male     a conscienceless hermaphrodite who plays    heaven off against hell  hell off against heaven     revolving in the ballroom of the skies    glittering with conflict as with diamonds     we have wasted paradox and mystery on you    when all you ask us for  is cause and effect       christopher fry    the lady   s not for burning    no question is so difficult to 
answer as that to which the answer is obvious      george bernard shaw    one    the world  branson thought  is like that circus act of long ago  back in the sweet colored days of childhood  when the big top was as high as the sky  and gigantic horses marched the earth     he remembered the act  the ragged clown teetering on the high wire  clutching his misshapen hat  reeling toward destruction  catching himself in that last throat thickening instant to flounder some more  you 
believed in him then  that poor dazed clown  petrified by height  yet trying with pathetic and humble courage to please the crowd  taking from the baggy clothes the white dinner plates and  fighting his fear and his constant losses of balance  managing somehow to juggle the plates  oh  how white they had shined in the spotlights     you could see how the awkward body would plummet to the hard earth  and you wanted to stop looking  yet could not stop  and then 
suddenly his balance became sure and certain  he stripped off the baggy clothes to reveal himself  taut and muscular in the spangled tights  bowing to applause  you laughed aloud into daddy   s eyes  knowing how close you had been to tears     now all the men of the world watched the humble clown on the high wire  he juggled atomics  and napalm and all the hundred ways to separate the soul from the body  either quickly or very slowly  he wavered up 
there in the spotlights and all the eyes watched  knowing that when at last he fell  it would all be gone    the tent and the music and the elephant girls  forever and ever  he had remained up there too long  the nerves of men were ground thin and fine  you waited for him to strip off the baggy clown clothes and bow to the applause of the world  but he never did  he was caught up there  impaled for eternity on 
the bright shafts of the spotlights     once he had seen a revival of a harold lloyd picture  he had seen it when he was a child  at the museum of modern art  and the picture  even then  had been fifty years old  the bespectacled man had been blindfolded and he was walking about in the steel beams of a building under construction  a skyscraper  back in the days when buildings stretched upward toward the sun  rather than downward into the warm 
safe earth     the comedian had not known he was a dizzy height in the air  he wandered about aimlessly  arms outstretched  when he stepped off into space a girder  being hoisted up from below  would always present itself just in time to take his weight  it had been one of those saturday showings  he remembered how all the children had screamed at the tension of that old silent film     maybe it was a truer analogy  because the clown was aware of 
his danger  and the comedian walked in an absurd innocence     now the museum of modern art was gone  and the dwindling radiation of the area was so slight that the lead sheaths on the buses were more to impress the tourists than from any real necessity     that had been the time  in the early seventies  when you had been certain that the clown would fall  that the beam would not arrive in time  but they had pocked one another   s cities 
with the new ugliness  hurled the dwindling wealth of the planet at each other for a time  ostensibly the democracies had won  the armies had hammered their way back and forth across europe for the third and last time  now  as had been predicted so many times before  europe was wasteland  physically and spiritually incapable of rising again from her knees  vassal states  with marginal resources  struggling for meager existence     somehow  insanely  the world had caught itself once more    saved itself 
on the very brink of destruction  of all the industrial economies left  only pak india  reunited  was capable of trying again  and india wasn   t interested  the astonishing effect on her standard of living as a result of the ruthless years of compulsory sterilization had given herthe vigor to absorb burma  thailand  ceylon  the malay peninsula and a rich slice of south china  reclamation of jungle and desert gave her the most solid basis of raw materials in the world  with 
the exception  perhaps  of brazil  which had but recently moved her seat of government to buenos aires     it wasn   t  branson thought  the line up that anyone could have guessed back in the days before the war  communism  both as a religion and as a political theory  had failed when its pie in the sky hadn   t materialized  it had failed when it had run up against man   s peculiarly basic desire to do as he damn pleased     each time the 
world tottered on the high wire  it recovered its balance in a weird and wonderful way  now pak india was the king pin democracy  with the united states trying to assure itself that it was a full partner  rather than  as was obvious to any objective person  a junior partner  huddled together under india   s skirts were all of the nations of europe except spain     all the nations  including those new nations which were the result of a partitioned russia  also 
 under the same skirt  was australia  canada     but the clock had turned backward and the new enemy was the old enemy all over again  fascism    a strong triple coalition of brazil  which had taken over three quarters of the south american continent  marching and singing under the silver banners of garva  and north china  singing the same songs  though with oriental dissonance  under a man called stephen chu  and irania  which included arabia  egypt  most of north africa marching with burnoose
