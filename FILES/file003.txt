the body on the screen he had unfolded  she walked out of the alcove and stood waiting  she heard the water running in the alcove sink  after a time the whirring stopped  and then the sound of water  her companion came out  refolding the screen  he nodded and she went to the office door  opened it  darwin branson stood outside  his face as empty as death  she motioned to him  he walked in woodenly and took his seat behind the desk 
 the man leaned over and whispered one word into darwin branson   s ear  he nodded to the girl and they went out of the office  closed the door        thirty seconds     the girl said  the man knocked on the office door  darwin branson came to the door        i   m afraid you have the wrong office     darwin branson said politely     the young man smiled    sorry  sir  i guess i have  pardon me for bothering you           perfectly all right     branson said  the couple walked 
to the stairs  they went down five stairs and waited  they heard the elevator come up  stop  the door clanged open  two men walked toward branson   s office     the man nodded at the girl  she responded with a quick  almost shy smile  it was full night  he opened the stairwell window and they stepped easily out onto the narrow sill above the street  he closed the window behind them  they reappeared in the same instant on the high cornice of a 
building across the square  they looked down into the lighted office below  where three men were talking earnestly  then the couple played a wild game  flickering like black flames from one high stone shoulder to the next  until at last he seemed to guess her intent and appeared at the same instant she did on the splintered stub of the statue of liberty in the harbor  touched her shoulder before she could escape  they laughed silently  it had been like the 
crazy game of children who had finished a hard lesson  they clasped hands and were gone      back in the office darwin branson talked to smith  he instinctively did not like the man  did not trust him  smith had     an oily look  a slippery look  perhaps it would not be wise to trust him with the whole picture  he looked as though he could twist it this way and that  turn it inside out and find there some advantage for himself     dake 
lorin sat  apparently taken in by smith  darwin branson felt a bit contemptuous toward dake lorin  that young man was so     excessively noble  so naive and gullible  dake would have you believe that the world could become a garden of eden once again  sitting there  the whole preposterous six feet six inches of him  with that harsh black hair  and the dumb shelf of brow over the shadowed eyes  giving his face a simian look  as though dake were some great 
sad ape trying mournfully to rectify the errors of mankind  dake was just the type to be taken in by this oily smith person     as darwin branson talked he wondered why he had wasted the past year on this chase of the wild goose  a few compromises would make no difference  the world was war bound  and robert enfield should stop kidding himself  stop thinking that the united states could step in withsub rosa mediation and stave off disaster  the crucial 
point  rather  was to select the winning side while there was still time to make a selection     he saw that smith was aware of his contempt  and he was amused     two    smith had been awkwardly skeptical  he was a moon faced man with nail head eyes  fat babyish hands  dake lorin had exerted himself to be charming  to make a friend of this smith  it had been most difficult  he kept thinking that smith was a complicated mechanical doll  and if 
you tripped the wrong reflex  you would be inundated by the standard line  irania is strong  irania is quick  irania is brave  our leader  george fahdi  is farsighted     smith was in the country on a forged passport  arranged with the oblique assistance of one of the under secretaries of state  dake had picked him up in boston to drive him down to the conference with darwin branson     the trick was to get under the automatic pseudo patriotic reflex  and get down 
to the man himself     dake drove the small nondescript car at a sedate sixty five  slowing for the stretches of neglected shattered slabs  the car  like most of the works of man  was a shade too small for dake lorin  his knees and elbows seemed always to be in the way        i understand your leader was impressed with mr  branson        smith shrugged    he told me later that he felt mr  branson was a great rarity  a good man  there are not 
many good men           i   ve worked with mr  branson for a year        smith turned in the seat    so  you are     by trade  a government employee           not by trade  by trade i guess i   m a newspaperman  i was filling in in the washington bureau a couple of years ago  i interviewed branson  he     stuck with me  the guy has quite an effect           you intrigue me     smith said in his toneless voice     dake made a small decision  in order to disarm this 
smith he would have to do a bit of a striptease  let his soul show a bit    i   ve always been a lone wolf type  mr  smith  maybe a bit of a visionary  that state of mind always had a cause  i suppose  when i was twelve  a wide eyed kid  the police picked up my dad  he was a smalltime politician  and a thief  he would have been safe all his life  but there was a change of administration and 
they threw him to the wolves  it was a deal  he was supposed to get eighteen months  but the judge crossed them up and dad got ten years  when he found out that his old pal  the governor  wasn   t going to pardon him  he hung himself in his cell  my mother pulled herself together and we got along  somehow  i had a lot of schoolyard scraps  it made a mark on me  i guess  i grew up with a chip
