to detect the tiniest loopholes  slide through them  they had met after he had taken a casual swipe at her in his column  criticizing her for buying into an indian land deal to take advantage of the tax concessions washington had given the investment of indian capital     patrice had appeared in his office at thebulletin the next morning  blue eyes like ice  jaw set  hair a bright flow of autumn barley  she had leaned both fists on his desk  breasts lifting 
with the deep breathing of her controlled anger        you  my friend  are out of your depth this time     she said        and you  lady  are an anachronism  you are a female pirate  you are a con artist           you cost me more money yesterday than you   ll make in your whole life           then the least i can do is buy your lunch        they glared at each other  grinned suddenly  laughed aloud and went out together  it had been at first a good friendship 
 even though their personal philosophies were poles apart  for two basically aloof people  it had been a warmth of friendship that had quite astonished them  they found they laughed more often when they were together  one night  in front of the november fireplace in her small home  he had kissed her  expecting it to be casual  finding it to be shockingly hungry     they were friends  and they became lovers without losing all of friendship  she was almost six feet tall  yet 
built in perfect feminine scale  they laughed about being in a world too small for them  they did not use the word   love    or the word    marriage     they were faithful to each other without perceptible effort  they were discreet in an age that jeered at discretion  for a time their physical preoccupation with each other became obsessive  but when they recognized the danger of that  recognized the weakness of it  they fought free of it into a relationship which was rather 
like that of two semi alcoholics who would excuse themselves for an infrequent three day bender     together they acquired a sixth sense about what subjects to avoid  they knew that they were two proud  strong  dominant people  who happened to believe in different things  there was too much artillery they could bring to bear on each other  it was enough for him to see the morning sun in the warmth of her hair  hear fond laughter in her throat  hold her 
through her quickened times of completion     the inevitable blowup came when he told her why he was taking a   leave of absence     it had been an unpleasant scene  even as they fought  neither of them retreating a step  he guessed that she too was aware of the loneliness to come  the empty aching nights     the taxi driver examined the tip  grunting something that could have been thanks  and clattered off  dake went up the walk  knowing that no fortress was ever 
as well protected as this house  this small tidy house  knowing that by breaking the infra red beams he had become target  he stood on the porch  waiting  the door was suddenly opened by the pretty japanese maid  who gave him a gold toothed smile and said  as though he had visited there yesterday    good evening  mr  lorin           evening  does             she knows you are here  sir  she will be right down  a brandy  sir  i   ll bring it to you in 
the study        he was amused  the study was for business transactions  the lounge living room was for friends  he wondered if patrice were prescient  simpler than that  perhaps  she knew him well  she knew his inflexibility  and so she would know that this was not a personal call  he sat in one of the deep leather chairs  the maid brought the brandy  an ancient bottle  and two bell glasses on a black tray  she put them on the small table beside 
his chair  and left without a sound     when he heard patrice   s distinctive step he stood up quickly and smiled at her as she came into the study  her smile was warmer than he expected  as always  she had that remembered look of being larger than life size  more vital  she wore dark red tailored slacks  a matching halter        quite a tan  patrice     he said        i got back from acapulco yesterday           pleasure trip     he asked wryly  her hands warm and firm 
in his     she made a face    a good buy  hotel property           with your indian pals           uh uh  some brazilian pals this time           both ends against the middle  patrice           of course  how else does a girl get along     she inspected him  her head tilted to one side     you look gaunter  darling  hollow eyed  i bet your ribs show           the strain of being a do gooder           aren   t we being just a little bit too nasty nice to each other     she held her 
hand up  thumb and forefinger an inch apart     just that much brandy  please  would i look too severe if i sat at the desk           not if it   s where your checkbook is        she bit her lip    this could be interesting  couldn   t it     she seated herself behind the desk  he took her the brandy  went back to the deep chair      she sipped  watching him over the rim  she set the glass down and said    i have a feeling we   re going 
to spar  and it might be nasty  and before we spoil each other   s dispositions  i want to say something  i   ve had a year to plan just exactly how i should say it  just this  dake  i   ve missed you  quite horribly  i wanted  and tried  to buy you and put you in stock  it didn   t work  i   ve been going around rationalizing it  telling myself that if youcould be purchased  i wouldn   t want you  but i   m 
not that way  i wish youcould be  i wish you had sense enough to be  life has plenty of meaning without you  it had more when you were around  i miss that increment  i   m a selfish  hard fisted  dominating woman  and if there   s any way i can acquire you permanently  i   m going to do it           okay  patrice  equal candor  i   ve missed you  i   ve wished that either you or i could bend a little without breaking  but
