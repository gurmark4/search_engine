in the seat for the short run  the spattered lights of the city wheeled under one wing  the other two passengers were a pair of madrassi businessmen  they conversed in hindi and dake could catch words now and then  enough to know that they were talking about the philadelphia branch of the bank of india     he could never quite become accustomed to being considered by the pak indians a second class citizen  toynbee had coldly outlined the ecology of civilizations  the 
great wheel had turned slowly  and the east was once again the new fountainhead of vitality  their discrimination was subtle  but implacable  in major cities indian clubs had been established  americans could be taken there as guests  but were forbidden membership  there had been a fad when american women had begun to wear saris  to make imitation caste marks on their foreheads  the pak indian ambassador had called on the president  saris disappeared from the shops  fashion magazines hinted that caste 
marks were crude  even rude  everyone was happy again  for a time it had been possible to emigrate to india  that new land of opportunity  but so many had taken advantage of it that restrictions became very tight  and it was still possible  but very very difficult to manage  involving a large cash bond  though the war of the seventies had done much to alleviate racial tension in the states  there had still been small though influential negro groups who had 
joyously welcomed the dominance of a dark skinned race in world affairs  they had soon found  to their dismay  that the pak indians were supremely conscious of being  in truth  an aryan race  and brought to any dealings with the negro that vast legacy of hatred from the years of tension in fiji  culminating in the interracial wars  of pak india proper  only ceylon had any percentage mixture of negro blood  due to the african invasions of ancient years  but ceylon 
was to pak india much as puerto rico had been to the united states prior to brazilian annexation     indians would treat you with courtesy  even with affability  but in any conversation with them you could detect  running like a symphonic theme through the orchestration of words  their conviction that you were a citizen of a decadent nation  one that had gone beyond its peak of influence in world affairs  one that was doomed to the inevitable status of a supplicant nation 
 free in name only     we had it  he thought  and we threw it away  we ripped our iron and coal and oil out of the warm earth  used our copper and our forests and the rich topsoil  and hurled it all at our enemies  and conquered them  and were left at last with the empty ravaged land  how could it have been avoided  what could we have done that we did not do  should we have used that great moment of 
momentum in       well over thirty years ago  and gone on to take over the planet  should we have dropped the sword  misered our resources  and succumbed meekly during the increasing pressures of the middle sixties  how did it come about that any step we could take was wrong  that every course open to us was but a different road to a different classification of disaster  england had been dying too    just a few scant years ahead of us in the inexorable 
schedule  yet we had been unable to learn from her defeats  unable to cut a new channel  it was almost  he thought  as though there was some unanswerable paradox against which every world power must inevitably run and collapse  some cold and alien influence in the world  breaking the hearts of men     or perhaps it is all merely our own stupidity  our blindnesses  our inability to see and comprehend the obvious  perhaps we are all like darwin branson  able for a 
time    even for a sustained length of time     to influence our environment for good  yet always failing somehow in that last crucial moment  as branson had failed when the blindness came over him     he wondered what patrice would say  he dreaded seeing her  her love was a contradiction  she seemed capable of loving every aspect of him as a human being except his final  innermost motivation     unscathed philadelphia had its standard joke about itself  when  during the war  many of the 
executive branches of government had to be evacuated to philadelphia  and when the city itself was not bombed  the philadelphians proclaimed that the enemy had been smart enough to realize that by obliterating all the red tape  they would be helping the u  s  instead of hurting it  the air of immunity had carried over into the present time of fear  there was less underground construction here than elsewhere  it was a prim  old lady city  walking through the mud with 
its skirts carefully held up  not too daringly  and with a wise and knowing air as though that old lady  in her almost forgotten youth  had raised a bit of forbidden hell      deceleration thrust him forward against the straps  and ten minutes later he was in a wheezing  clattering taxi headed toward patrice   s unexpectedly modest home near upper darby  patrice   s father had died in       just one week and two days before the passage of the hundred percent inheritance tax 
bill  his fortune had its beginnings back when the original gundar togelson had been pirating oil land from mellon  each togelsonsince then had increased it until the late sixties when the capital gains tax was revised to take seventy percent of all capital gains  after inheritance taxes  patrice  in addition to maximum gifts each year her father was alive  inherited about five and a half millions  at the present time it wasnearly the last fortune left relatively intact  inside the country 
 under the impact of the confiscatory taxes many people had managed to emigrate with their funds to economically sunnier lands  just as the socialist government in england had driven many private fortunes to bermuda and elsewhere     patrice togelson  a tall  warmly built viking girl  had brought to dake a deep  earthy  physical need  yet he knew that in the management of her money she was like flint  and like quicksilver  like flint in her calculating hardness  like quicksilver in her ability
