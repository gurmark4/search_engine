muscles  felt the uprush of the black crazy anger that was his greatest curse  the blindness came  and he was unaware of his movements  unaware of time    aware only that he had somehow reached across the desk to grab the front of branson   s neat dark suit in one huge fist  had lifted the smaller man up out of the chair  he shook him until the face was blurred in his vision        dake     the man yelled     dake        the anger slowly receded 
 he dropped branson back into the chair  he felt weak and he was sweating        sorry     he said        you   re a madman  lorin           you   re a cheap little man  branson  i have a hunch  i have the feeling there are people who   ll understand exactly how you sold out the human race on this deal  and i   m going to put the case before them  all of it  every part of it  then let the world judge you  branson           now just a 
moment  this involves a question of security  lorin  i can have you classified as potentially subversive  have you sent to labor camp until you cool off  you know that           i don   t think you can stop me           you   ve been engaged in secret negotiations  any violation of security will be evidence of your disloyalty        dake said softly    and you   re the man who called those regulations  called the labor camps  the new barbarism  government by aboriginal decree  you changed overnight  darwin 
 you   re not the same man  i   ll do what i can  and you can kindly go to hell           while you   re doing it  examine your own motives again  dake  maybe you   ve spent your life looking for martyrdom  and this is your best opportunity           that   s a low blow           you   re upset  dake  in a way i don   t blame you  disappointment is hard to take  but you are my friend  i don   t want to see you hurt        dake 
stared at him for long seconds  there was nothing else to say  he turned on his heel and left the office  slamming the door violently behind him  taking wry pleasure in the childishness of the gesture     three    in the stately cathedral hush of the austere times news offices the following morning  dake lorin was slowly and uneasily passed up the ladder from managing editor to assistant publisher  to publisher  he sat in paneled waiting rooms  eyed by myriad horse teethed young 
ladies  by deftly innocuous young men  this was not the newspaper world with which dake was familiar  the war  with its wood pulp starvation  had brought about the combine of the last two competing dailies  and during the darkest hours the paper had been down to four half size sheets  with the ubiquitous   shurdlu    appearing in almost every story     now the paper was back to a respectable bulk  photo printed on the tan grainy paper made of weeds and grasses  here 
was no muted thud and rumble of presses  no bellows for   boy     here was an air of sanctimonious hush        he will see you now  mr  lorin     a slat thin female announced     dake went into the inner office  the window dioramas were of wooded hills  blue mountain lakes  the publisher was a small round man with matronly shoulders and a dimpled chin        sit down  mr  lorin     he said  he held a card between thumb and forefinger  as though it were something nasty 
       i refreshed my mind  mr  lorin  the morgue typed me a summary  your name  of course  was familiar to me the moment i heard it  let me see now  combat correspondent  wounded  married while on leave in     wife killed by bombing of buffalo when the suicide task force was repulsed  returned to job as reporter on philadelphiabulletin  did a good job of covering convention in      and became a political columnist  syndicated in sixty two papers at peak  quite a bit of 
influence  frequently under fire as a    visionary     a dreamer  columns collected into two books  reasonably successful  advocated second u n   until india withdrew and it collapsed  took a sudden leaveof absence a year ago  activities during the past year unknown  suspected to hold some ex officio position in current administration  state department side           age thirty two  twenty nine teeth  scimitar shaped scar on left buttock  very undignified wound  you know     lorin said        eh           never mind  has anyone told you my reason 
for seeing you           mr  lorin  i am terribly afraid that the     ah     philosophy behind your political theorizing of the past would not be in accord with our             i don   t want a job  i have one exclusive i want to give to you  i want to write it and i want the best and biggest splash you can give it  i came here because you have world readership           an exclusive  our people dig  mr  lorin  we insist on that  i seriously 
doubt whether there could be any new development in     ah     your field which has not already been          dake interrupted bluntly  hitching his chair closer  lowering his voice    how about this sort of an exclusive  mr  haggins  darwin branson did not retire  he was given a very delicate mission by president enfield  i worked on it with him for a year  the idea was to act as a middleman  to ease off world tension by getting all sides to do a little 
horse trading  it was to be done in secrecy  and in the strictest honesty  all sides but irania have agreed to make honest concessions  irania was the last one  if branson had dealt with irania firmly and honestly  we could have had a chance to see at least five years of peace ahead of us  but i was present when branson blew the whole scheme sky high by trying to make a second level deal with the iranian representative  irania will 
make a token concession  of no value  then the others will water down their concessions  and the net result will be more world tension instead of less  i doubt whether your     diggers have uncovered that  mr  haggins  i want you to make a big splash so that the world can know how close it came to temporary nirvana  it might do some good  it might be like a nice clean wind blowing through some very dusty parliamentary sessions  your sheet is
